_This is the first ever **`Go`** project we have done. As we were new to golang, we tried to learn and implement our project features.
As a first project, we couldn't follow well maintained project architecture thus file stuctures are not well organized. However we are trying to improve this. The project is live at here: **[https://ajudge.net](https://ajudge.net)**_

We are trying to integrate Bangladeshi Online Judge's in a virtual platform.
This includes:
- DimikOJ
- LightOJ 
- Toph

We are also working to add a popular online Judge which is:
- URI

And finally we are adding an existing virtual judge which is:
- VJudge

We are thankful to all of the Online Judge's we are working on and also to VJudge.

Thanks from:
- Nahid Hasan.
- Saiful Islam.
